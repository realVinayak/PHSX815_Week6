<h1>Homework 6</h1>
Calculates integral of $x^2sin(x)$ in integral 4 to 7 with 300 interval.
Set the lower bound of integration as `min_limit`. Set the upper bound of the integration as `max_limit`. Set the number of intervals as `N_inter`. The variables are definition in `driver.py`.
<br/>
To run code, type `python3 driver.py`

<h1>Homework 7</h1>
Calculates integral of $x^2sin(x)$ in integral 3.2 to 6 
with 9000 sample points using Monte Carlo method. The range 3.2 to 6 
is chosen because target function is negative in this entire range.
The error is measured by comparing against quadrature result and analytic result
